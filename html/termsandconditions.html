                <p>A. <strong>E9-1-1 Service -</strong> You will have E9-1-1 service if your VOIP Service telephone number corresponds to your address and municipality where you permanently use your VOIP Service and E9-1-1 is available in your serving area. If you dial 9-1-1, your call is automatically routed to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) corresponding to your address and the emergency operator will have your telephone and address information. You may be required to verify your name, telephone number and address with the emergency operator.</p>
                <p>B<strong>. Basic 9-1-1 Service</strong> - Basic 9-1-1 service is provided in the following two situations. You will have Basic 9-1-1 Service if your VOIP Service telephone number does not correspond to your address and municipality where you permanently use your VOIP Service or if you live in a serving area in which E9-1-1 from Smart Telecom is not available. If you dial 9-1-1, you will be automatically routed to a specialized call center that handles emergency calls. The call center is different from the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) that would answer a traditional emergency call.

You have access to 9-1-1 service, but because you may be out of the coverage area of Your Public Safety Access Point (PSAP), whenever you dial 9-1-1, you will be automatically routed to a specialized call center that handles emergency calls. The call center is different from the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) that would answer a traditional emergency call. You will be required to provide your name, telephone number, and address to the call center operator.</p>
                <p>(iii) <strong>SERVICE OUTAGES - </strong>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT DURING SERVICE OUTAGES BY YOUR BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER OR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, YOUR VOIP SERVICE INCLUDING 9-1-1 SERVICE, WILL NOT WORK.

IF THERE IS AN INTERRUPTION IN THE POWER SUPPLY, THE VOIP SERVICE, INCLUDING 9-1-1 SERVICE, WILL NOT FUNCTION UNTIL POWER IS RESTORED. A POWER FAILURE OR DISRUPTION MAY REQUIRE YOU TO RESTART, RE-SET OR RECONFIGURE EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO USING THE VOIP SERVICE. SERVICE OUTAGES DUE TO SUSPENSION OF YOUR ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF BILLING ISSUES WILL PREVENT VOIP SERVICE, INCLUDING 9-1-1 SERVICE.</p>
